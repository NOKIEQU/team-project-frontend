                        By accessing or using Game Vault ("we," "our," or "us"), you agree to these Terms & Conditions. If you donâ€™t agree, well... you can always rage quit, but weâ€™d rather you stay! </p>

                        You must be at least 13 years old (or have permission from a responsible adult).

                        You agree to use Game Vault only for legal and non-shady activities.

                        Weâ€™re not responsible for any unauthorized access to your account. Use strong passwords!

                        If you suspect suspicious activity, contact support ASAP. </p>

                        All prices are in USD (unless stated otherwise) and may change faster than a speedrunner completing a level.

                        Digital game codes are non-refundable once redeemed.

                        Physical games can be returned if they meet our Return Policy. </p>

                        Engage in harassment, hate speech, or general toxic behavior.

                        Try to break our website (seriously, our developers are already stressed enough).

                        Violate any applicable laws or regulations. </p>

                        All content on Game Vault (logos, text, images, game descriptions) belongs to us or our partners.

                        Donâ€™t steal, copy, or use our content without permission, or weâ€™ll have to level up our legal team. </p>

                    <p className="text-xl text-black p-2">7. Limitation of Liability

                        We try our best to keep everything running smoothly, but we canâ€™t guarantee 100% uptime (even the best servers need a break).

                        We are not responsible for any in-game losses, corrupted saves, or unfortunate encounters with game-breaking bugs. </p>

                    <p className="text-xl text-black p-2">8. Termination

                        If you break these rules, we may suspend or terminate your account without warning.

                        If you think we made a mistake, you can appeal by contacting our support team. </p>

                    <p className="text-xl text-black p-2"> 9. Changes to These Terms

                        We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make big changes, weâ€™ll let you know (but checking this page regularly is a good habit!). </p>
